# marketMachine
a model that follows technical indicators and correctly and accurately assess market fluctuations and automatically invest money into good positions. We would want to return a weighted value from these formulae and invest a proportional amount of liquid capital into whatever stock is deemed favorable.  
Market Machina: if no new weekly stock model is published, create a new one due to the program (intentially) crashing and trigggering the catch statement which automatically creates a new model for that week. Make sure you use non empty folder for the models and scalers plz I havent figured out how to create new directories yet. If someone is reading this please let me know
